	<h2>Lyrics</h2>
	<h3 id="KillMyMind">kill My Mind</h3>
		<p>You're a nightmare on the dance floor<br>
And you hate me, and I want more<br>
You're a total distraction<br>
While I'm waiting for your reaction<br>
Why, ah, ah, ah<br><br>

The devil in my brain<br>
Whispering my name<br>
I can hear it sayin', ah, ah, ah<br>
I can ease the pain<br>
Just a little taste babe<br>
And ya won't let go of your hold on me<br><br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

Kept me living<br>
From the last time<br>
From a prison of a past life<br>
On a mission just to feel like<br>
When you kissed me for the last time<br>
Why, ah, ah, ah<br><br>
The devil in my brain<br>
Whispering my name<br>
I can hear it sayin', ah, ah, ah<br>
I can ease the pain<br>
Just a little taste babe<br>
And ya won't let go of your hold on me<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now</p><br>

<h3 id="DLIBYH">Don't Let it Break Your Heart</h3>
<p>On our way to Twenty Seven<br>
Got a place on the other side of London<br>
Doing better, doing better<br>
And I know you left a part of you<br>
In New York under your bed in a box<br>
But you're doing better, doing better<br><br>

Life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much, but it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br><br>

Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

It comes and it goes<br>
We're driving down a one-way road<br>
To something better, something better<br>
And what hurts you is gonna pass<br>
And you'll have learnt from it when it comes back<br>
You'll be doing better, yeah, doing better<br><br>

'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much, but it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br>
Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

Hey!<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) Hey!<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Hey!<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much and it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br><br>

Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Don't let it break your heart)<br><br>

Don't let it break your heart<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, don't let it break your heart)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Don't let it break your heart</p>

<h3 id="TwoOfUs">Two of Us</h3>
<p>It's been a minute since I called you<br>
Just to hear the answer phone<br>
Yeah, I know that you won't get this<br>
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone<br><br>

This morning I woke up still dreaming<br>
With memories playing through my head<br>
You'll never know how much I miss you<br>
The day that they took you<br>
I wish it was me instead<br><br>

But you once told me "Don't give up<br>
You can do it day by day"<br>
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

I could feel your blood run through me<br>
You're written in my DNA<br>
Looking back in every mirror<br>
I know you'll be waiting<br>
I'll see you again<br><br>

But you once told me "Don't give up<br>
You can do it day by day"<br>
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

I promised you I'd do this<br>
So all of this is all for you<br>
Oh, I swear to God, you're living<br>
Through everything I'll ever do<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

One life for the two of us<br>
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

We'll end just like we started<br>
Just you and me and no one else<br>
I will hold you where my heart is<br>
One life for the two of us</p>

<h3 id="WeMadeIt">We Made it</h3>
<p>'Cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Yeah, it's gonna be alright, like the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>

Oh my, I remember those nights<br>
Meet you at your uni, cheap drinks, drink 'em all night<br>
Staying out 'til sunrise<br>
Share a single bed and tell each other what we dream about<br>
Things we'd never say to someone else out loud<br>
We were only kids, just tryna work it out<br>
Wonder what they'd think if they could see us now<br><br>

Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Knew that we would be alright, from the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>
Oh God, what I could've become<br>
Don't know why they put this all on us when we're so young<br>
Done a pretty good job, dealing with it all when you're here<br>
Don't need to say no more<br>
Nothing in the world that I would change it for<br>
Singing something pop'y on the same four chords<br>
Used to worry 'bout it, but I don't no more<br><br>
Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Smoke something, drink something, yeah, just like the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>

With your hand in mine<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) No-no, no-no, 'cause we made it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, 'cause we made it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Never coming down with your hand in mine</p>

<h3 id="TooYoung">Too Young</h3>
<p>We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh<br>
We were too young<br><br>

I've been looking back a lot lately<br>
Me and you is all I've ever known<br>
It's hard to think you could ever hate me<br>
But everything's feeling different now<br><br>

Oh, I can't believe I gave in to the pressure<br>
When they said a love like this would never last<br>
So I cut you off 'cause I didn't know no better<br>
Now I realise, yeah, I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young<br><br>

Face-to-face at the kitchen table<br>
This is everything I've waited for<br>
Now we can finally have a conversation<br>
That I wish we could've had before<br><br>

Oh, I can't believe I gave in to the pressure<br>
When they said a love like this would never last<br>
So I cut you off 'cause I didn't know no better<br>
Now I realise, yeah, I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young<br><br>

It's been two years since I've seen your face<br>
Tryna find some better words to say<br>
Before I let this moment slip away<br>
'Cause now I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young</p>
