	<h2>Lyrics</h2>
	<h3 id="KillMyMind">kill My Mind</h3>
		<p>You're a nightmare on the dance floor<br>
And you hate me, and I want more<br>
You're a total distraction<br>
While I'm waiting for your reaction<br>
Why, ah, ah, ah<br><br>

The devil in my brain<br>
Whispering my name<br>
I can hear it sayin', ah, ah, ah<br>
I can ease the pain<br>
Just a little taste babe<br>
And ya won't let go of your hold on me<br><br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

Kept me living<br>
From the last time<br>
From a prison of a past life<br>
On a mission just to feel like<br>
When you kissed me for the last time<br>
Why, ah, ah, ah<br><br>
The devil in my brain<br>
Whispering my name<br>
I can hear it sayin', ah, ah, ah<br>
I can ease the pain<br>
Just a little taste babe<br>
And ya won't let go of your hold on me<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br>
Kill my, kill my, kill my<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br>
You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now<br><br>

You kill my mind<br>
Raise my body back to life<br>
And I don't know what I'd do without you now</p><br>

<h3 id="DLIBYH">Don't Let it Break Your Heart</h3>
<p>On our way to Twenty Seven<br>
Got a place on the other side of London<br>
Doing better, doing better<br>
And I know you left a part of you<br>
In New York under your bed in a box<br>
But you're doing better, doing better<br><br>

Life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much, but it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br><br>

Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

It comes and it goes<br>
We're driving down a one-way road<br>
To something better, something better<br>
And what hurts you is gonna pass<br>
And you'll have learnt from it when it comes back<br>
You'll be doing better, yeah, doing better<br><br>

'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much, but it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br>
Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

Hey!<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) Hey!<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Hey!<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up<br>
When you give so much and it's not enough<br>
When the high's too high, and the low's too low<br>
When you love someone and they let you go<br><br>

Don't you let it kill you<br>
Even when it hurts like hell<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Time takes time to heal it<br>
You can't do it by yourself<br>
Oh, whatever tears you apart<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br><br>

Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, hey!)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Don't let it break your heart)<br><br>

Don't let it break your heart<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, don't let it break your heart)<br>
Don't let it break your heart (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)<br>
Don't let it break your heart<br>
Don't let it break your heart</p><br>

<h3 id="TwoOfUs">Two of Us</h3>
<p>It's been a minute since I called you<br>
Just to hear the answer phone<br>
Yeah, I know that you won't get this<br>
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone<br><br>

This morning I woke up still dreaming<br>
With memories playing through my head<br>
You'll never know how much I miss you<br>
The day that they took you<br>
I wish it was me instead<br><br>

But you once told me "Don't give up<br>
You can do it day by day"<br>
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

I could feel your blood run through me<br>
You're written in my DNA<br>
Looking back in every mirror<br>
I know you'll be waiting<br>
I'll see you again<br><br>

But you once told me "Don't give up<br>
You can do it day by day"<br>
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

I promised you I'd do this<br>
So all of this is all for you<br>
Oh, I swear to God, you're living<br>
Through everything I'll ever do<br><br>

So I will keep you, day and night<br>
Here until the day I die<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
I will be the best of me<br>
Always keep you next to me<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br>
Even when I'm on my own<br>
I know I won't be alone<br>
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song<br>
I know you'll be looking down<br>
Swear I'm gonna make you proud<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

One life for the two of us<br>
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)<br>
I'll be living one life for the two of us<br><br>

We'll end just like we started<br>
Just you and me and no one else<br>
I will hold you where my heart is<br>
One life for the two of us</p><br>

<h3 id="WeMadeIt">We Made it</h3>
<p>'Cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Yeah, it's gonna be alright, like the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>

Oh my, I remember those nights<br>
Meet you at your uni, cheap drinks, drink 'em all night<br>
Staying out 'til sunrise<br>
Share a single bed and tell each other what we dream about<br>
Things we'd never say to someone else out loud<br>
We were only kids, just tryna work it out<br>
Wonder what they'd think if they could see us now<br><br>

Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Knew that we would be alright, from the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>
Oh God, what I could've become<br>
Don't know why they put this all on us when we're so young<br>
Done a pretty good job, dealing with it all when you're here<br>
Don't need to say no more<br>
Nothing in the world that I would change it for<br>
Singing something pop'y on the same four chords<br>
Used to worry 'bout it, but I don't no more<br><br>
Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated<br>
Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times<br>
Smoke something, drink something, yeah, just like the first time<br>
Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted<br>
Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high<br>
Never coming down with your hand in mine<br><br>

With your hand in mine<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) No-no, no-no, 'cause we made it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, 'cause we made it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Never coming down with your hand in mine</p><br>

<h3 id="TooYoung">Too Young</h3>
<p>We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh<br>
We were too young<br><br>

I've been looking back a lot lately<br>
Me and you is all I've ever known<br>
It's hard to think you could ever hate me<br>
But everything's feeling different now<br><br>

Oh, I can't believe I gave in to the pressure<br>
When they said a love like this would never last<br>
So I cut you off 'cause I didn't know no better<br>
Now I realise, yeah, I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young<br><br>

Face-to-face at the kitchen table<br>
This is everything I've waited for<br>
Now we can finally have a conversation<br>
That I wish we could've had before<br><br>

Oh, I can't believe I gave in to the pressure<br>
When they said a love like this would never last<br>
So I cut you off 'cause I didn't know no better<br>
Now I realise, yeah, I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young<br><br>

It's been two years since I've seen your face<br>
Tryna find some better words to say<br>
Before I let this moment slip away<br>
'Cause now I realise<br><br>

We were too young to know we had everything<br>
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along<br>
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh, oh<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young (Ooh, ah)<br>
We were too young</p><br>

<h3 id="Walls">Walls</h3>
<p>Nothing wakes you up like waking up alone<br>
And all that's left of us is a cupboard full of clothes<br>
The day you walked away and took the higher ground<br>
Was the day that I became the man that I am now<br><br>

But these high walls, they came up short<br>
Now I stand taller than them all<br>
These high walls never broke my soul, and I<br>
I watched them all come falling down<br>
I watched them all come falling down for you<br>
For you<br><br>

Nothing makes you hurt like hurtin' who you love (hurting who you love)<br>
And no amount of words will ever be enough (never be enough)<br>
I looked you in the eyes, saw that I was lost (saw that I was lost)<br>
For every question "why", you were my "because" (you were my "because")<br><br>

But these high walls, they came up short<br>
Now I stand taller than them all<br>
These high walls never broke my soul, and I<br>
I watched them all come falling down<br>
I watched them all come falling down for you<br>
Falling down for you<br><br>

So this one is a thank you for what you did to me<br>
Why is it that 'thank you's' are so often bittersweet<br>
I just hope I see you one day and you'll say to me, "Oh, oh"<br><br>

But these high walls, they came up short<br>
Now I stand taller than them all<br>
These high walls never broke my soul, and I<br>
I watched them all come falling down<br>
I watched them all come falling down for you<br>
Falling down for you<br><br>

Nothing wakes you up like waking up alone</p><br>

<h3 id="Habit">Habit</h3>
<p>I always said that I'd mess up eventually<br>
I told you that, so what did you expect from me?<br>
It shouldn't come as no surprise anymore<br>
I know you said that you'd give me another chance<br>
But you and I knew the truth of it in advance<br>
That mentally you were already out the door<br><br>

Never thought that giving up would be so hard<br>
God, I'm missing you and your addictive heart<br><br>

You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the feeling I can't put down<br>
You're the shiver that I can't shake<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the high that I need right now<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br><br>

I took some time 'cause I've ran out of energy<br>
Of playing someone I heard I'm supposed to be<br>
But honestly, I don't have to choose anymore<br>
And it's been ages, different stages<br>
Come so far from Princess Park<br>
I'll always need ya<br>
In front of me, in front of me<br><br>

You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the feeling I can't put down<br>
You're the shiver that I can't shake<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the high that I need right now<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br><br>

You gave me the time and the space<br>
I was out of control and I'm sorry, I let you down<br>
Guess that I know what I already knew<br>
I was better with you, and I miss you now<br><br>

You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the feeling I can't put down<br>
You're the shiver that I can't shake<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the high that I need right now<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br><br>

You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the feeling I can't put down<br>
You're the shiver that I can't shake<br>
You're the habit that I can't break<br>
You're the high that I need right now<br>
You're the habit that I can't break</p><br>

<h3 id="AlwaysYou">Always You</h3>
<p>
	I went to Amsterdam without you<br>
And all I could do was think about you<br>
And, oh, I should've known<br>
I went to Tokyo to let it go<br>
Drink after drink but I still felt alone<br>
I should've known<br><br>

I went to so many places<br>
Looking for you in the faces<br>
I could feel it<br>
Oh, I could feel it<br><br>

I'm wasting my time when it was always you, always you<br>
Chasing the high but it was always you, always you<br><br>

Should've never let you go, oh-oh<br>
Should've never let you go, my baby<br>
Go, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

I went from LAX to Heathrow<br>
Walk through my door but it felt nothing like home<br>
'Cause you're not home<br>
Waiting to wrap your legs around me<br>
And I know you hate to smoke without me and, oh<br>
Now you know<br><br>

I'm wasting my time when it was always you, always you<br>
Chasing the high but it was always you, always you<br><br>

Should've never let you go, oh-oh<br>
Should've never let you go, my baby<br>
Go, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

Should've never let you go, oh-oh<br>
Should've never let you go, my baby<br>
Go, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

I went to so many places<br>
Looking for you in the faces<br>
I could feel it<br>
Oh, I could feel it<br><br>

Wasting my time when it was always you, always you<br>
I was chasing the high but it was always you, always you<br><br>

Should've never let you go, oh-oh<br>
Should've never let you go, my baby<br>
Go, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

Should've never let you go, oh-oh<br>
Should've never let you go, my baby<br>
Go, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

My baby<br>
Oh, my baby

<p>
	Cash in your weekend treasures<br>
For a suit and tie<br>
A second wife<br>
Now, I'm not saying that you could have done better<br>
Just remember that I, I've seen that fire alight<br><br>

Tell me, do you<br>
Tell me do you still remember feeling young?<br><br>

Tell me the truth<br>
Tell me do you still remember feeling young<br>
Strong enough to get it wrong<br>
In front of all these people?<br>
Just for tonight, look inside<br>
And spark that memory of you<br>
Strong enough to get it wrong<br>
In front of all these people<br><br>

Fearless, fearless<br>
Fearless, fearless<br><br>

Now, if happiness is always measured<br>
By the life you design<br>
That car in the drive<br>
Then you should feel better than ever<br>
But you know as well as I<br>
It's all lies<br><br>

Tell me, do you<br>
Tell me do you still remember feeling young?<br><br>

Tell me the truth<br>
Tell me do you still remember feeling young<br>
Strong enough to get it wrong<br>
In front of all these people?<br>
Just for tonight, look inside<br>
And spark that memory of you<br>
Strong enough to get it wrong<br>
In front of all these people<br><br>

Fearless, fearless<br>
Fearless, fearless<br>
Fearless, fearless<br>
Fearless, fearless<br><br>

Tell me, do you<br>
Tell me do you still remember feeling young?

<h3 id="PerfectNow">Perfect Now</h3>
<p>
	You say to me your jeans don't fit<br>
You don't feel pretty and it's hard to miss<br>
I wish that you could see my point of view<br>
As someone staring back at you<br>
One Friday night when we're all out<br>
I turn to you and you're looking down<br>
And you don't wanna dance<br>
I know you love to dance<br>
You never stop given half the chance<br><br>

Just keep your head up, love, keep your head up<br>
Don't hide away, don't ever change<br>
Keep your head up love, keep your head up<br>
Don't look away, don't look away<br><br>

'Cause everybody's looking at you now<br>
My, oh, my<br>
I guess some queens don't need a crown<br>
And I know why<br>
Even when your tears are falling down<br>
Still somehow<br>
You're perfect now<br><br>

You never do but if you asked me to<br>
I'd tell the truth lying next to you<br>
'Cause you're the only one<br>
When it's said and done<br>
You make me feel like being someone good to you<br>
Even at your worst<br>
You steal the scene and it's unrehearsed<br>
Don't you wanna dance, just a little dance?<br>
I would never stop given half the chance<br><br>

Just keep your head up, love, keep your head up<br>
Don't hide away, don't ever change<br>
Keep your head up love, keep your head up<br>
Don't look away, don't look away<br><br>

'Cause everybody's looking at you now<br>
My, oh, my<br>
I guess some queens don't need a crown<br>
And I know why<br>
Even when your tears are falling down<br>
Still somehow<br>
You're perfect now<br><br>

Every insecurity<br>
Like a neon sign<br>
As bright as day<br>
If you knew what you were to me<br>
You would never try to hide away<br><br>

'Cause everybody's looking at you now<br>
My, oh, my<br>
I guess some queens don't need a crown<br>
And I know why<br>
Even when your tears are falling down<br>
Still somehow<br>
You're perfect now

<p>
	I come running to you like a moth into a flame<br>
You tell me take it easy but it's easier to say<br>
Wish I didn't need so much of you<br>
I hate to say but I do<br><br>

We're sleeping on our problems like we'll solve them in our dreams<br>
We wake up early morning and they're still under the sheets<br>
I'm lost in my head, I'm spinning again<br>
Tryna find what to say to you<br><br>

Been up all night<br>
All night, running all my lines<br>
But it's only the truth<br>
Been up all night<br>
Not sure how to say this right<br>
Got so much to lose<br><br>

Never been so defenceless<br>
Never been so defenceless<br>
You just keep on building up your fences<br>
But I've never been so defenceless<br><br>

(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
You just keep on building up your fences (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
But I've never been so defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br><br>

No, you don't have to keep on being strong for me and you<br>
Acting like you feel no pain, you know, I know you do<br>
And I can't get inside when you're lost in your pride<br>
But you don't have a thing to prove<br><br>

Been up all night<br>
All night, running all my lines<br>
But it's only the truth<br>
Been up all night<br>
Not sure how to say this right<br>
Got so much to lose<br><br>

Never been so defenceless<br>
Never been so defenceless<br>
You just keep on building up your fences<br>
But I've never been so defenceless<br><br>

(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
You just keep on building up your fences (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
But I've never been so defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br><br>

I hope that I'm not asking too much<br>
Just wanna be loved by you<br>
(Don't be so defensive)<br>
And I'm too tired to be tough<br>
Just wanna be loved by you<br><br>

Never been so defenceless<br>
Never been so defenceless<br>
And you just keep on building up your fences<br>
But I've never been so defenceless<br><br>

(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
You just keep on building up your fences (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
Defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
Never been so defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
Never been so defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
You just keep on building up your fences (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)<br>
But I've never been so defenceless (Ooh, ooh, ooh-oh)

<h3 id="OnlyTheBrave">Only the Brave</h3>
<p>
	Pour mercy, mercy on me<br>
Set fire to history<br>
I'm breaking my own rules<br>
I'm crying like a fool<br>
Tall stories on the page<br>
Short glories on the fade<br>
I've been close enough to touch<br>
But I never cared for love<br><br>

It's a church of burnt romances<br>
And I'm too far gone to pray<br>
It's a solo song<br>
And it's only for the brave<br><br>

If the truth tell<br>
Darling, you fell<br>
Like there ain't enough dying stars in your sky<br>
It's a tall tale<br>
And it's only hello, hello, no goodbye<br><br>

Pour mercy, mercy on me<br>
I'll fall upon my knees<br>
And they'll say, "I told you so"<br>
Come on, when you know, you know<br>
All the lonely shadow dances<br>
From the cradle to the grave<br>
It's a solo song<br>
And it's only for the brave
</p><br>

<p>"If it all goes wrong, darling just hold on!"</p>
